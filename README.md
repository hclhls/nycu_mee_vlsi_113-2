## Course Description
This course introduces students to the fundamentals of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design, focusing on CMOS technology, circuit characteristics, and physical design principles. Students will learn open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and gain hands-on experience in designing integrated circuits.

## Prerequisites
- Circuit Theory
- Microelectronics
- Digital Logic Design
- Basic programming knowledge

## Course Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand fundamental CMOS technology and scaling
- Analyze and design basic CMOS circuits
- Apply layout design rules and understand fabrication processes
- Use open-source EDA tools for learning RTL2GDS flow
- Complete a basic digital VLSI design project

## Required Materials
- Textbook: "CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective" by Weste and Harris, 4th Edition
- Software: [VLSI Stick Diagrammer](https://stixu.io/), [Ngspice](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/), [Icarus Verilog](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/), [Yosys](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/), [OPENROAD](https://openroad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
